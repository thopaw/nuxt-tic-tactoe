# tictactoe-nuxt

This project was used to give a group of pupils a small project to play with.
The structure is kept very simple so that they can play a little bit with this app
without to struggle with to many vue/nuxt concepts. 

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
